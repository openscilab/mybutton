## Overview

MyButton is an open-source project that simplifies the process of sharing links of your preferred online services. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to seamlessly share links with just a few clicks. MyButton takes care of the technical aspects. Depending on the chosen service, it might:

-   Forward users to the chosen platform with the link already populated for easy sharing.
-   Generate sharable buttons embedded with your link. Clicking these buttons redirects users to the chosen service.

You can choose to forward users either directly to the platform or through the MyButton gateway for added flexibility.

✨ Easily fork MyButton to create a custom link-sharing experience tailored to your brand, and deploy it smoothly on GitHub Pages.
