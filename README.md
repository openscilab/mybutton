## Overview

MyButton is an open-source project that streamlines the process of sharing links to your preferred online services. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to seamlessly share content with just a few clicks. MyButton takes care of the technical aspects. Depending on the chosen service, it might:

-   Redirect you directly to the platform with the link pre-populated.
-   Generate sharable buttons embedded with your link. Clicking these buttons redirects users to the chosen service.
